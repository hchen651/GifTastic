# __Giftastic!__
#### [__Giftastic__](https://hchen651.github.io/portfolio/giftastic/index.html) is a dynamic web app that allows user to get a selection of gifs by entering a search term.

### How does it work?
1. Click on any category button at the top of page. 10 gifs will be generated below.
2. When a new category button is clicked, the images will be refreshed per new category chosen.
3. Click on any image to animate it.
4. Enter a new category in search bar to add an animal (or anything else!) to the categories.

### Project Goal
Using AJAX calls to retrieve objects, the app implements the GIPHY API to generate gifs of category chosen. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and JQuery.
